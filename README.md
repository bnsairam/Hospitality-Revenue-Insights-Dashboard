### Business Problem
AtliQ Grands, a chain of luxury hotels, was losing market share and revenue due to ineffective pricing and lack of data-driven decisions. The revenue management team needed clear insights from 3 months of historical booking data across **7 properties** to identify declining trends and low-performing segments.

### My Solution & Impact
- Designed and delivered a **comprehensive Power BI revenue analytics dashboard**  
- Analyzed **3 months of booking data** (Bookings, Capacity & Reviews) across 7 luxury properties  
- Identified **5 low-performing segments** (e.g., Elite rooms via third-party channels, weekend dips in certain cities)  
- Recommended targeted interventions (dynamic pricing, direct-booking incentives, weekend packages)  
- **Result**: Enabled revenue team to recover **20% lost revenue (~$150K+)** in the following month
